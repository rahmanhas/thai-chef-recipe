                        <p>Ans-1: The primary difference between a controlled component vs an uncontrolled component is related to how they handle their value. Uncontrolled components pass down the value through props. In contrast, controlled components use state to handle the value internally. For most use cases, controlled components are the best option in code.</p>

                        <p>Ans-2: Props and PropTypes are important mechanisms for passing read-only attributes between React components. We can use React props, short for properties, to send data from one component to another. If a component receives the wrong type of props, it can cause bugs and unexpected errors in your app. Since JavaScript doesnâ€™t have a built-in type checking solution, many developers use extensions like TypeScript and Flow. However, React has an internal mechanism for props validation called PropTypes.If a dog chews shoes whose shoes does he choose?</p>

                        <p>Ans-3: Node.js is a platform for building the i/o applications which are server-side event-driven and made using JavaScript. Express.js is a framework based on Node.js which is used for building web-application using approaches and principles of Node.js event-driven architecture.</p>

                        <p>Ans-4: Custom React JS hooks are reusable functions that a React JS software developer can use to add special and unique functionality to the React applications. Usually, if there is a requirement to add a feature, one can install a third-party library and solve. Custom React JS hooks can help developers save time, are reliable, reusable, and make the code clean. Creating custom React JS hooks is relatively easy, and you can search for many open sources where you can get some custom hooks from the library already created by developers. </p>
